# credit-card-fraud-detection

### Objective -
The aim of this project is to build a classifier that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. We will do so using 3 machine learning algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Gradient Descent

### Conclusion - 
We were able to achieve more than 99% accuracy for all three models.
